"./beach-with-tower-1.jpg"
"./cruise-ship-in-water-1.jpg"
"./edge-of-island-1.jpg"
"./mountain-side-view-down-1.jpg"
Please contact me if you would like to like to use these anywhere else. Do not use them without my permission, or do, this is a readme, not a cop.
The only reason the default pictures in here are mine is because I'm trying to avoid copyright problems. Feel free to use copyrighted stuff for your background, just change the image path in the manifest file.
